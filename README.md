Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.
Rules:
Consider a board with the nine positions numbered as follows:
1	2	3
4	5	6
7	8	9
This is a game against Computer.
In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Therefore , a player named as X , will win if he/she places marks X diagonally in 1,2,3 or 4,5,6 or 7,8,9 position or places marks vertically in 1,4,7 or 2,5,8 or 3,6,9 or can also place marks diagonally in 1,5,9 or 3,5,7  .
Otherwise its a draw!
Workflow:
Introduce the game
Making the board(Defining function to print the board everytime a move is made)
Using while loop to keep game going until its a win or draw.
Using if ,elif ,else statements to define conditions for win or draw.
Importing Random library to let one player be computer.
Finally,importing sys library to exit in case of win or draw.
